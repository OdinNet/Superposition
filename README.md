🌱 Superposition: Intelligent Plant Monitoring System

**Superposition** is a hardware and software project created by a startup passionate about sustainability, precision agriculture, and smart ecosystems. 
Our mission is to empower anyone, from home gardeners to commercial growers. With accurate, real-time environmental data to better care for plants.

# What We're Building

At its core, **Superposition** is a smart monitoring system that gathers real-world data from plants and their environment through a dedicated hardware device.
This device tracks key environmental factors and sends the data to a mobile/web application for intuitive visualization and insights.

# Hardware Features

Our first-generation hardware unit is designed to measure:

- **🌞 Sunlight Intensity** – Helps understand if your plants are getting the right amount of light.
- **💧 Soil Moisture** – Monitors water levels in soil to prevent overwatering or underwatering.
- **🌡️ Air Temperature** – Tracks local ambient temperature.
- **💦 Air Moisture (Humidity)** – Measures humidity levels to maintain ideal plant growth conditions.

Future versions will include:
- CO₂ levels
- pH sensors
- Light spectrum analysis
- Soil Quality analyzer
- And more...

# Software & App

We're developing a cross-platform mobile/web application that:
- Seamlessly connects with the Superposition hardware.
- Displays real-time environmental data in an intuitive dashboard.
- Uses AI (planned) to provide personalized care suggestions, watering schedules, and alert systems.

#Tech Stack (Planned/Under Development)

Hardware
- Arduino/CircuitPython-based microcontrollers
- Analog and digital environmental sensors
- Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity

Software


# 💡 Why "Superposition"?

Inspired by the idea that plants, like particles, thrive in delicate balance, "Superposition" captures our mission to observe and influence multiple plant conditions at once—creating harmony from complexity.
